# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (WIP)

Degree project in mathematics where i'm predicting stock price using machine learning models and comparing the results between the models.

## Overview

* Using data from the Swedish stock market I create machine learning models to predict stock price.
  
* Main factors are stock price, and time.

* this analysis will help get an insight into what kind of machine learning models and features are best suited for stock price prediction.

* This will be done using only python.

## Objectives

 Using data from the Swedish stock market I will:

* Explore the data and find relationships between target and feature variables in order to find the best ones for stock price prediction.
  
* Create features and targets (eg. RSI, moving averages).
  
* Create machine learning models (linear regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, neural network, (or long short-term memory)).
  
* Tune the models using hyperparameters.
  
* Measure precision and accuracy using mathematical measurements, such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R^2.
  
* Compare the models to eachother to inquire how they compare when predicting stock price.
